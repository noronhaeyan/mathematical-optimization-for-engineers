# MOOC Mathematical Optimization for Engineers

This repository contains my implementation of Lab files for the MOOC "Mathematical Optimization for Engineers"

You can find the MOOC [here](https://www.edx.org/learn/math/rwth-aachen-university-mathematical-optimization-for-engineers)

You can download the files and run the code on your local machine and save your progress. 

Or you can run the files on Binder.org in a new tab.
